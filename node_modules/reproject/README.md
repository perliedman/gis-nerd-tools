reproject
=========

Takes GeoJSON in one projection/CRS and transforms, or reprojects, it to another.

## cli

install:

    $ npm install -g reproject

use:

    $ echo '{"type":"Point","coordinates":[319180, 6399862]}' | reproject --use-spatialreference --from=EPSG:3006 --to=EPSG:4326

Options:

* ```--from=crs-name``` is the CRS to convert the GeoJSON from
* ```--to=crs-name``` is the CRS to convert the GeoJSON to
* ```--use-spatialreference``` or ```--sr``` to use [spatialreference.org](http://spatialreference.org/) to look up
  any CRS definitions that aren't already known
* ```--crs-defs=file``` to provide a JSON dictionary of known CRS definitions. A sample file of CRS definitions, crs-defs.json, is supplied.
* ```--reverse``` to reverse the axis (swap x and y) before performing the reprojection

reproject can be used together with for example [wellknown](https://github.com/mapbox/wellknown/) and [geojsonio-cli](https://github.com/mapbox/geojsonio-cli/):

    $ echo "POINT(319180 6399862)" | wellknown | reproject --crs-defs=crs-defs.json --from=EPSG:3006 --to=EPSG:4326 | geojsonio

## usage

Installation is easy with npm:

    npm install reproject

It works well in the browser with for example [browserify](http://browserify.org/).

## api

### reproject(geojson, from, to, crss)

Reprojects the given GeoJSON from the CRS given in **from** to the CRS given in **to**.

The from and to arguments can either be a proj4 projection object, or a string containing a CRS name. In
the case of a CRS name, the proj4 projection instance is looked up using the **crss** argument. **crss**
is assumed to be a dictionary of projection names to proj4 objects.

If from is left undefined or null, the CRS will be detected from the GeoJSON's crs property and looked up in the
**crss** dictionary.

### toWgs84(geojson, from, crss)

Shortcut equivalent to

```js
reproject(geojson, from, proj4.WGS84, crss)
```

### detectCrs(geojson, crss)

Detects the CRS defined in the given GeoJSON and returns the corresponding proj4 projection instance from
crss. If no CRS is defined in the GeoJSON, or the defined CRS isn't present in **crss**, an error is thrown.

### reverse(geojson)

Reverses the axis order of the coordinates in the given GeoJSON, such that x becomes y and y becomes x.
